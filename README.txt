Project Description

	Title: ‘Into Oblivion - Forest Adventure Game’

	Description: In this game, the story is that the player finds themselves in a strange forest that contains 
		     monsters/creatures and in order to get home, they must get through the forest (which is represented 
                      by going through different levels of mazes).
	
	
		    Easy Mode - if the player dies, they have to redo their current level until they get to the next one. 
		    Hard Mode - if the player dies, they are back at the beginning of the forest (aka level one) and start all over.

		    *Note - if the user doesn't pick a mode, Easy Mode will be the default. 

	*Additional Note - In the video demo I believe I said that the user must collect at least 30 crystals to win, but it's actually 35 crystals needed to win.




How to run the project
